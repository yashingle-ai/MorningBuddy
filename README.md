## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or newer
* API keys for the following services:
    * [Google AI (Gemini)](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
    * [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys)
    * [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/register)
    * [SerpApi](https://serpapi.com/manage-api-key)

### 2. Project Setup

**1. Clone the repository (Optional - or just create the files):**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/morning-buddy.git](https://github.com/your-username/morning-buddy.git)
cd morning-buddy
````

**2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

**3. Install dependencies:**
Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```
streamlit
google-generativeai
requests
python-dotenv
```

Install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Create the `.env` file:**
Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project. This file will store your secret API keys.

```ini
GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY"
NEWS_API_KEY="YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY"
SERPAPI_API_KEY="YOUR_SERPAPI_API_KEY"
```

### 3\. File Structure

Your project should be organized as follows (based on the provided code):

```
morning-buddy/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ applications.py   # Backend logic, API functions, Gemini calls
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py            # Streamlit frontend UI and page routing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env              # Stores all your secret API keys
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt  # Project dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md         # You are here
```

  * `applications.py`: Contains all the backend logic, including API-calling functions (`get_weather`, `get_news`, `find_local_events`) and the Gemini-powered processing functions (`temperature_of_city`, `news_summarizer`, `smart_plan`).
  * `app.py`: Contains all the Streamlit code for the user interface, page routing, and custom CSS.

## Usage

Once your setup is complete, run the Streamlit application from your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the web server and open the "Morning Buddy" app in your default web browser. You can then navigate between the Home, Weather, News, and Planner pages using the sidebar.
